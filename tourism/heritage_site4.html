    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Odeon of Herodes Atticus is a historic theater located on the southwestern slope of the Acropolis. It is renowned for its impressive acoustics and classical architecture.</p>
    <p><strong>History:</strong> Built in 161 AD by the Athenian magnate Herodes Atticus in memory of his wife, the Odeon was used for musical performances and dramatic plays. It was originally covered by a wooden roof, which has since been lost, but the structure remains a prominent example of Roman-era theater construction.</p>
    <p>Renovations in the 1950s restored the Odeon to its former glory, allowing it to host various performances and cultural events. It remains one of the most celebrated venues for the Athens Festival and other significant events.</p>
