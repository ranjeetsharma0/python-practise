      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>The Parthenon was constructed during the height of the Athenian Empire under the leadership of Pericles. Designed by architects Ictinus and Callicrates, it replaced an earlier temple destroyed by the Persians. The Parthenon was designed as a symbol of the power and prosperity of Athens. It was originally adorned with a massive statue of Athena, created by the sculptor Phidias. Throughout history, the Parthenon has served various purposes, including as a Christian church, a mosque, and even an ammunition depot. The building has suffered significant damage over the centuries, including an explosion in 1687 that caused severe damage. Despite this, the Parthenon remains one of the most important and iconic structures of classical antiquity.</p>
